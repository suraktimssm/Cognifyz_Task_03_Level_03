🤖 Task Automation — Level 3 Task 3

This project automates a repetitive task using Python: organizing files automatically based on file type.
It demonstrates practical automation, file handling, and problem-solving skills.

🚀 Task Overview:

The tool scans a target folder and automatically sorts files into categorized subfolders like:

a)Images

b)Documents

c)Videos

d)Music

e)Archives

f)Others

Each file is moved into the correct folder based on its extension.

🧠 What the Script Does:

1)Scans your chosen directory

2)Checks each file’s extension

3)Creates necessary category folders

4)Moves each file into the correct folder

5)Puts unknown file types into an “Others” folder

This eliminates manual sorting and keeps your directories clean.

📌 How to Run:

1)Replace the folder path with your actual folder:

folder_path = "C:/Users/YourUsername/Downloads"

2)Save the script as file_organizer.py

3)Run it using:

python file_organizer.py


4)Watch your files sort themselves automatically ✔

🔍 Key Takeaways:

1)Hands-on automation using Python

2)File handling with os and shutil

3)Practical real-world use case

4)Perfect for showcasing automation skills in Python
